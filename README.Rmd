## Overview

This project is dedicated to study the impact of mesoscale eddies on forage fauna at global scale. This GitHub repository provides the code of the Receveur et al. (2024) publication in Nature Communication. In this sutdy, we sample 1000 eddies spread in four ocean with active acoustic. 

## Data sources

This project uses the following acoustic databases:

The global atlas of eddy trajectories is available here [link](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/value-added-products/global-mesoscale-eddy-trajectory-product/meta3-2-dt.html).

## Workflow

The analysis pipeline follows these steps:

1. Download eddy data
2. Download acoustic data
3. Overlap the two data sources to only keep acoustic data inside and around eddies 
4. Make and Export the Figures 1 and 2
5. Compare inside acoustic values to outside acoustic values in each eddy 
6. Make and Export the Figures 3 and 4
7. Compare the spatial distribution of the results with the previously published results

## Content

This repository is structured as follow:

- [`data/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/eddy_micronecton/tree/main/data): contains a sampled of data used in the article. The folder is split in two folders: [`data/raw/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/eddy_micronecton/tree/main/data/raw) to find a sample of all raw data (acoustic, eddy trajectories, chloro and sst) ; and [`data/intermediate/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/eddy_micronecton/tree/main/data/intermediate) with some intermediate .Rdata files, to make easily the Figures. 


- [`figures/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/eddy_micronecton/tree/main/figures): contains the figures used to validate et visualize the outputs.


- [`scripts/`](https://github.com/auroreRECE/eddy_micronecton/tree/main/scripts): contains R scripts to run the workflow. The order to run these scripts is explained in each name of files and follow the Workflow description.
